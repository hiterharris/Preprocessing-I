          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My journey as a front end engineer started as a student at the Iron Yard Coding School where I learned the basics of web design and development and applied them to different projects.  The design skills included understanding the design process, sketching, wire-framing, mockups, and prototypes.  The development skills included HTML, CSS/SASS, and JavaScript/jQuery.  Having the background in both design and development is important to me because I now have worked with designers as a developer as well as having worked with developers as a designer.  The Iron Yard gave me a good introduction to design and development but after graduating I knew I wanted to focus more on development.</p>

          <p>My name is Hiter Harris and I am a front-end engineer and UI/UX designer. I’m a former NCAA track & field athlete and member of the USA bobsled team.</p>

          <p> I’m passionate about self improvement whether it’s in my career, education, or health. I enjoy waking up each day with the opportunity to get better at something.</p>
           
         <p>I want to continue to use the skills I’ve learned to design and build new projects for others to use to make their lives easier.</p>

              <h3>Front End Engineer</h3>
              <p>As a front end engineer at Levvel, I worked on a full stack web application for the company’s intranet that allows employees to nominate and vote for co-workers based on how they exemplify Levvel’s core values.  My work focused on implementing the nomination flow, voter flow, and admin page.  I used React for the front end, Node and Express for the back end.  I also used Apollo Client to fetch data from our API and GraphQL to write queries and mutations to access and update the database.</p>
